In the practical, the SIR codes did not take too much time. The SIR vaccination codes was easy with the help of the SIR codes. However, the spatial SIR codes took me more than 1 hour because it used array to encode different states. I was not familiar with array operations. After the practical, I improved my skills to work with arrays. I realized the importance of vaccination. And it was great fun watching probabilistic models produce different results every time.
